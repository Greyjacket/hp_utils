1H23888P,"California Photo - ""Twenty mule team"" borax wagons and the Harmony Borax Works in California's Death Valley - Carol Highsmith, 1H23888","<p>""Twenty mule team"" borax wagons at the Harmony Borax Works in California's Death Valley. According to the National Park Service, the Harmony Works was the central feature in the opening of Death Valley and the subsequent popularity of the Furnace Creek area. After borax was found near Furnace Creek Ranch (then called Greenland) in 1881, William T. Coleman built the Harmony plant and began to process ore in late 1883 or early 1884. When in full operation, the Harmony Borax Works employed 40 men who produced three tons of borax daily. During the summer months, when the weather was so hot that processing water would not cool enough to permit the suspended borax -- a white, alkaline mineral used in cleaning products and toothpaste -- to crystallize, Coleman moved his work force to the Amargosa Borax Plant near present day Tecopa, California. Getting the finished product to market from the heart of Death Valley was a difficult task, and an efficient method had to be devised. The Harmony operation became famous through the use of large mule teams and double wagons, which hauled borax the long overland route to Mojave. The romantic image of the ""20-mule team&#65533;? persists to this day and has become the symbol of the borax industry in this country. The Harmony plant went out of operation in 1888 after only five years of production, when Coleman's financial empire collapsed. </p><p>Credit line: The Jon B.

Soaring above the upper Sacramento River Valley are the sky-scraping spires of granite called the Castle Crags. From the lofty ramparts, the hiker can look down on forested slopes and up at magni&#65533;?cent snow-covered Mt. Shasta. The Castle Crags were formed in much the same manner as nearby Mt. Shasta and the other peaks of the Cascade Range by volcanic activity some 200 million years ago. For the last million years, the Crags have been subjected to the forces of wind, rain, ice and even some small glaciers, which have shaped the granite into its distinctive shapes. Rising beside the spikey peaks is a round one, Castle Dome, which many mountaineers liken to Yosemite's Half Dome. In 1855, the territory below the Crags was the site of a struggle between local native people and settlers. The locals, armed only with bows and arrows, were driven from their land in a one-sided battle that was chronicled by Joaquin Miller, ""poet of the High Sierra.&#65533;? </p><p>Carol M.

Pickett in the Stockyards District of Fort Worth, Texas. Pickett, an African-American cowboy who originated the rodeo event of bulldogging, later better known as steer wrestling. He became the first black cowboy to be inducted into the National Cowboy Hall of Fame in 1971, appeared in rodeos at the stockyards coliseum many times in the early 20th century. The Stockyards neighborhood celebrates a former livestock market that operated under various owners from 1866. Fort Worth Union Stockyards opened for business on January 19, 1890, covering 206 acres. By 1886 four stockyards had been built near the railroads. Boston capitalist Greenleif W. Simpson, with a half dozen Boston and Chicago associates, incorporated the Fort Worth Stock Yards Company on March 23, 1893, and purchased the Union Stock Yards and the Fort Worth Packing Company. The stockyards was an organized place where cattle, sheep, and hogs could be bought, sold and slaughtered. Fort Worth remained an important part of the cattle industry until the 1950s. Business suffered due to livestock auctions held closer to the where the livestock were originally raised. Today the Stockyards consist of mainly entertainment and shopping venues that capitalize on the ""Cowtown"" image of Fort Worth. They are the last standing stockyards in the United States. Some volunteers still run the cattle drives through the stockyards -- in fact parading them briefly at a walk before tourists lining Exchange Street.</p><p>Credit line: The Lyda Hill Texas Collection of Photographs in Carol M.

Three years later the federal government agreed to create a small lake on land provided by the county. The county commissioners court purchased a site 2.5 miles southwest of Denison in October 1933 and secured the services of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), a federal public works program, to construct the dam and build a recreational park. In early November, 200 men from Wisconsin who comprised CCC Company 857 arrived in Grayson County to begin construction. Many men returned home in April 1934 at the end of the six-month contract. Though it was unusual to employ CCC workers in their own areas, 48 Grayson County men were enlisted to replenish the supply of workers in Company 857. By 1934 the CCC men had created a recreation center with a lake, a roadway, 13 culvert bridges, six ""battleship&#65533;? picnic units, a baseball diamond, and a partially completed central tower of native stone. Initially called Grayson County Park, the facility was renamed Judge Jake L. Loy State Park in 1934 in an effort to secure state assistance in completing the park. The commissioners court retrieved custody of the park in 1937 after no state maintenance had occurred.""

On Thanksgiving Day, 1929, San Angelo welcomed a theater that presented everything from Broadway musicals to first-run movies. The first show was ""The Hollywood Revue,&#65533;? and it was first seen by the general public at 9:30 a.m. on Thanksgiving Day. The theater's equipment made San Angelo one of the first cities in the nation to play motion pictures. Inside, stars twinkled overhead while clouds floated across the ceiling, the designer's effort to recreate the night sky. In the 1940s, the Texas Theatre was ""the"" spot for entertainment for servicemen stationed at Goodfellow Field, Concho Field, and San Angelo Army Airfield. Owned by John D. Jones, the theater played a central role in raising money for the war effort. From 1948 through 1950, the theater underwent minor remodeling, resulting in a Texas motif facade and the neon marquee. Patronage declined severely in the 1970s due to ashortage of parking, the increasing use of television for home entertainment ,and a slowdown of movie productionThe Texas Theatre closed in September 1983. There were plans to reopen the theater as a ""dollar house,"" showing second-run movies, but the plans were never realized. In 1998 the theater was sold to Lee Pfluger and Kenneth Gunter, who intended to protect the historic building, forestall the possibility that it might be bought by someone who might damage its historical character, and find a suitable person to develop the property, but the theater did not reopen.</p> <p>Credit line: The Lyda Hill Texas Collection of Photographs in Carol M.

The church, located on the northeast corner of Dwight Way and Bowditch Street, was designed by Bernard Maybeck in 1910. The Church is considered Bernard Maybeck's masterpiece. In the words of Kenneth Cardwell, Maybeck's biographer, ""no other building demonstrates so completely Maybeck's imaginative architectural genius [...] with its masterly handling of space, structure, color, and light.&#65533;? Others have remarked that it is one of the Bay Area's greatest architectural monuments, a monument of inner beauty and strength, an inspiration for unique formulations of space, light, and texture and perhaps simply one of the great buildings of the world. Indeed, most anthologies on American architecture include this church.</p><p>Carol M.

It replaced a small 1867 wooden structure that sat on the same spot. Thanks to the wealth and influence of Wyoming cattle barons, the railroad built one of the finest depots in America, complete with Richardsonian styling and the rare use of polychromatic stones -- two colors of sandstone from the same quarry. The ""tunnel' through the Depot is a portico, originally intended only for carriages of the rich. The Seth Thomas clock in the tower was added in 1890. A restaurant that locals called the ""Beanery&#65533;? was introducedin 1922. The lobby was redesigned in art deco style in 1929. The building was extensively restored in 2004.</p><p>Carol M.
